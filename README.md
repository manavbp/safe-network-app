## Downloading 

Downloading from the GitHub releases page on Linux, using an AppImage will require adding execution permission on some linux dists:

`chmod +x <safe network app>.AppImage`

## Building

-   `git clone`
-   `yarn`
-   `yarn dev`

### Testing

-   `SNAPP_DRY_RUN=true yarn dev`

This will not write to the filesystem, but will log to the console what changes it would have made.

## Releases

-   Fork the SAFE Network App repository
-   Clone repo locally or ensure the latest commit has been pulled if it is already cloned.
-   Before running yarn commands, remove the RC tags previously generated from both local and remote.
-   To install the dependencies run `yarn`.
-   Update the version number in the package.json.
-   We need to push these changes to origin repo, and ensure the changes are merged to master.
-   Run `yarn deploy` to release the packages.
